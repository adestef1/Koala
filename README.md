# Koala
Koala extension:
To upload the extension, first go to your chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions/). Then hit the top right button to enter
developer mode. Then in the top left click the "Load Unpacked" button. Then in your folder, navigate to the Koala folder you 
downloaded from our github and open it (You might have to unzip the file first). The extension should then be installed. If the
instillation is successful, you should see a koala icon on the top right of your browser and google.com should display a picture
of a koala. Clicking on the koala icon will display options.
